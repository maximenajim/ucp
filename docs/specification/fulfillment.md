# Fulfillment Extension

## Overview

The fulfillment extension enables businesses to advertise support for physical
goods fulfillment (shipping, pickup, etc).

This extension adds fulfillment fields to Checkout:

* `fulfillment_context` — session-level context used before method options are
    computed, such as a store already chosen by the buyer
* `methods[]` — fulfillment methods applicable to cart items (shipping, pickup, etc.)
    * `line_item_ids` — which items this method fulfills
    * `destinations[]` — where to fulfill (address, store location)
    * `groups[]` — business-generated packages, each with selectable `options[]`
* `available_methods[]` — inventory availability per item (optional)

**Mental model:**

* `methods[0]` Shipping
    * `line_item_ids` 👕👖
    * `selected_destination_id` = `destinations[0].id` 🔘✅ 123 Fake St
    * `groups[0]` 📦👕👖
        * `selected_option_id` = `options[0].id` 🔘✅ Standard $5
        * `options[1]` 🔘 Express $10
* `methods[1]` Pick Up in Store
    * `line_item_ids` 👞
    * `selected_destination_id` = `destinations[0].id` 🔘✅ Uptown Store
    * `groups[0]` 📦👞
        * `selected_option_id` = `options[0].id` 🔘✅ In-Store Pickup
        * `options[1]` 🔘 Curbside Pickup

## Schema

Fulfillment applies only to items requiring physical delivery. Items not
requiring fulfillment (e.g., digital goods) do not need to be assigned to a
method.

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Rendering

Fulfillment options are designed for **method-agnostic rendering**. Platforms
do not need to understand specific method types (shipping, pickup, etc.) to
present options meaningfully. The business provides precomputed,
human-readable fields that platforms render directly.

### Human-Readable Fields

| Location              | Field         | Required | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `title`       | Yes      | Primary label that distinguishes from siblings          |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `description` | No       | Supplementary context for the title                     |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `total`       | Yes      | Price in minor units (may be null if not yet available) |
| `available_methods[]` | `description` | No       | Standalone explanation of alternative availability      |

### Business Responsibilities

**For `options[].title`:**

* **MUST** distinguish this option from its siblings
* **SHOULD** include method and speed (e.g., "Express Shipping", "Curbside Pickup")
* **MUST** be sufficient for buyer decision if `description` is absent

**For `options[].description`:**

* **MUST NOT** repeat `title` or `total`—provides supplementary context only
* **SHOULD** include timing, carrier, or other decision-relevant details
* **SHOULD** be a complete phrase (e.g., "Arrives Dec 12-15 via FedEx")
* **MAY** be omitted if title is self-explanatory

**For `available_methods[].description`:**

* **MUST** be a standalone sentence explaining what, when, and where
* **SHOULD** be usable verbatim in platform dialogue (e.g., "Pants available
    for pickup at Downtown Store today at 2pm")

**For ordering:**

* Businesses **SHOULD** return `options[]` in a meaningful order (e.g., cheapest
    first, fastest first)
* Platforms **SHOULD** render options in the provided order

### Platform Responsibilities

Platforms **SHOULD** treat fulfillment as a generic, renderable structure:

* Render each option as a card using `title`, `description`, and `total`
* Present options in the order provided by the business
* Present all methods returned—method selection is a buyer decision
* Use `available_methods[].description` to surface alternatives to the buyer

Platforms **MAY** provide enhanced UX for recognized method types (store
selectors
for pickup, carrier logos for shipping), but this is optional. The baseline
contract is: **`title` + `description` + `total` is sufficient to render any
option.**

When a buyer selects an option the platform cannot fully process, the
platform **SHOULD** use `continue_url` to hand off to the business's checkout.

## Available Methods

Available methods indicate whether an item can be fulfilled with a given
method, and when. Use cases:

* **Alternative methods**: "These pants are also available for pickup at Downtown Store"
* **Fulfill later**: Preorders, items shipping from a distant warehouse, pickup when store gets inventory

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/checkout op=read -->
```json
{
  "ucp": { ... },
  "id": "...",
  "status": "...",
  "currency": "...",
  "line_items": [ ... ],
  "totals": [ ... ],
  "links": [ ... ],
  "fulfillment": {
    "methods": [
      {
        "id": "shipping",
        "type": "shipping",
        "line_item_ids": ["shirt", "pants"]
      },
      {
        "id": "pickup",
        "type": "pickup",
        "line_item_ids": []
      }
    ],
    "available_methods": [
      {
        "type": "shipping",
        "line_item_ids": ["shirt", "pants"],
        "fulfillable_on": "now"
      },
      {
        "type": "pickup",
        "line_item_ids": ["pants"],
        "fulfillable_on": "2026-12-01T10:00:00Z",
        "description": "Available for pickup at Downtown Store today at 2pm"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `description` field enables platforms to surface alternatives to buyers:

> 🤖 The shirt and pants ship for $5, arriving in 5-8 days. Or the pants can
> be picked up at Downtown Store in 4 hours.

If the buyer chooses pickup but the platform doesn't support split
fulfillment, the platform **SHOULD** use `continue_url` to hand off to the
business's checkout.

## Store-Anchored Checkout

Catalog and location discovery can use `context.geo`, `location_filter`, and
`signals["dev.ucp.shopping.geo"]` to find nearby options. These fields are
discovery signals; they are not checkout selections.

When a buyer has already chosen a store or other buyer-visible location before
checkout options are computed, the platform MAY send
`fulfillment_context.location_id` on checkout create or update. This anchors the
session without transmitting buyer geo. The business resolves that identifier
to the relevant destinations and options in the checkout response.

`selected_destination_id` remains method-level: it selects a destination from a
specific `methods[].destinations[]` array after the business has returned
options. It does not replace the session-level anchor.

## Pickup, Curbside, and Local Delivery

UCP defines `curbside` and `local_delivery` as protocol-blessed method types
alongside `shipping` and `pickup`.

Businesses SHOULD use:

* `pickup` for buyer collection inside or at a designated pickup point
* `curbside` for buyer collection at a location with an arrival or handoff flow
* `local_delivery` for delivery from local inventory to a buyer destination

Fulfillment options MAY include `pickup_window`, `delivery_window`,
`hold_duration`, `order_cutoff_time`, `minimum_order_quantity`, and
`depends_on_eligibility` to describe buyer-visible constraints.

## Configuration

Businesses and platforms declare fulfillment constraints in their profiles.
Businesses fetch platform profiles to adapt responses accordingly.

### Platform Profile

Platforms declare their rendering capabilities using `platform_schema`:

{{ schema_fields('types/platform_fulfillment_config', 'fulfillment') }}

Platforms that omit config or set `supports_multi_group: false` receive
single-group responses. The response shape is always
`methods[].groups[]`—the difference is whether `groups.length` can exceed 1
within each method.

Default declaration (single group per method):

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=platform_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout"
    }
  ]
}
```

Opt-in declaration (business MAY return multiple groups per method):

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=platform_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
      "config": { "supports_multi_group": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Business Profile

Businesses declare what fulfillment configurations they support using
`merchant_config`:

{{ schema_fields('types/merchant_fulfillment_config', 'fulfillment') }}

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=business_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
      "config": {
        "allows_multi_destination": {
          "shipping": true
        },
        "allows_method_combinations": [["shipping", "pickup"]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This example says: shipping can go to multiple addresses, and carts can mix
shipping+pickup.

### Business Response Behavior

**When `supports_multi_group: false` (default):**

* Business **MUST** consolidate all items into a **single group per method**
* Response still uses array structure: `methods[].groups[]` with `groups.length === 1`
* Business **MAY** still return multiple methods (e.g., shipping + pickup) if
    cart items require it

**When `supports_multi_group: true`:**

* Business **MAY** return multiple groups per method based on inventory,
    packaging, or warehouse logic
* Platform is responsible for rendering group selection UI (e.g., choose
    shipping speed per package)

### Adding New Methods

UCP distinguishes two paths for new fulfillment method types:

1. **Protocol-blessed methods** are universal, buyer-facing primitives added to
    the base `fulfillment_method.type` enum through the RFC process and a
    coordinated `dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment` capability version bump.
2. **Vendor-defined methods** are retailer- or category-specific variants that
    do not warrant protocol-wide blessing. These MUST be added via extension
    schemas with reverse-domain-named values, such as
    `com.example.drone_delivery`.

Protocol-blessed methods SHOULD be promoted only when they have distinct buyer
UX, distinct operational semantics, and broad applicability across multiple
businesses and platforms. When in doubt, propose a vendor-defined method first.

Platform `supports_multi_group` remains method-agnostic, so new method types do
not require a platform config field by default.

## Examples

                    "type": "total",
                    "amount": 500
                  }

            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Split Groups

**Config:** Platform profile requires `config.supports_multi_group: true`

Business splits items into multiple packages; buyer selects shipping rate per
package.

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/checkout op=read -->
```json
{
  "ucp": { ... },
  "id": "...",
  "status": "...",

  "fulfillment": {
    "methods": [
      {
        "id": "method_1",
        "type": "shipping",
        "line_item_ids": ["shirt", "pants"],
        "selected_destination_id": "dest_1",
        "destinations": [

          }
        ],
        "groups": [

            "options": [
              {
                "id": "standard",
                "title": "Standard",
                "totals": [ {"type": "total", "amount": 500} ]
              },
              {
                "id": "express",
                "title": "Express",
                "totals": [ {"type": "total", "amount": 1000} ]
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "id": "package_2",
            "line_item_ids": ["pants"],
            "selected_option_id": "express",
            "options": [
              {
                "id": "standard",
                "title": "Standard",
                "totals": [ {"type": "total", "amount": 500} ]
              },
              {
                "id": "express",
                "title": "Express",
                "totals": [ {"type": "total", "amount": 1000} ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Split Destinations

**Config:** Business profile requires
`config.allows_multi_destination.shipping: true`

Shirt ships to mom (US), pants ship to grandma (Hong Kong). Two methods of the
same type, each with its own destination.
